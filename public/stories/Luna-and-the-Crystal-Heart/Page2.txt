Emerging from a hidden path was Viridiana, the wise old tortoise. Her shell was a mosaic of jade greens and deep browns, worn with tales of yore. Her eyes sparkled like dew on a spring leaf, and her slow, deliberate movements were comforting. Viridiana told Luna about the Crystal Heart, a powerful gem that kept their world in harmony, perched atop the nearby Misty Mountain. Villanas, a stormy spirit with hair like swirling clouds and eyes of electric blue, threatened to shatter it.

With determination glowing in her eyes, Luna set forth on her journey. She crossed bubbling brooks and climbed rocky hills, her courage lighting the way as the sun began to sink. The Misty Mountain rose high into the twilight sky, its peak hidden beneath a veil of silver fog.
