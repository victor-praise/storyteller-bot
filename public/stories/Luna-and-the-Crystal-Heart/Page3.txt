At the summit, Luna confronted Villanas. His ghostly skin shimmered like dark thunderclouds, and his booming voice echoed with the rumble of distant thunder. Luna stood firm, her heart filled with light. Instead of fighting, she offered kindness, sharing the beauty of the Whispering Woods and the warmth of its creatures.

Touched by her compassion, Villanas's stormy facade began to clear, revealing a gentle spirit longing for peace. Together, they placed their hands upon the Crystal Heart, and the world was enveloped in a radiant glow.

As dawn broke, Luna and Villanas returned to the Whispering Woods, where life was once again filled with the songs of thrushes and the laughter of burbling brooks. The world was safe, and harmony was restored, thanks to the hero with the midnight-blue hair and the heart full of courage.
