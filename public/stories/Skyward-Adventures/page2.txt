One bright morning, while Avi was gliding over the fields, he noticed a thick, ominous cloud of smoke billowing from the heart of the sleepy village. His keen eyes caught sight of flames dancing dangerously close to the old wooden windmill, the pride of Windvale. Without a moment's hesitation, Avi swooped down, his nimble wings slicing through the air. With the villagers' eyes upon him, he summoned a powerful gust of wind with a mighty flap, whisking the flames away and saving the cherished windmill. That day, the skies echoed with joyous cheers, and Avi soared higher than ever, his heart full of pride and love for his beloved village.
