- **Evergreen Forest:** The forest is lush and vibrant, with tall, majestic trees draped in a carpet of green leaves that dance with the wind. Shafts of sunlight pierce through the canopy, painting dappled patterns on the forest floor, which is blanketed in soft moss and sprinkled with colorful wildflowers. The air is fresh and filled with the chirping of playful birds, and the gentle rustle of leaves creates a peaceful melody.

- **Surrounding Landscape:** Beyond the forest lies an expansive landscape where rolling hills merge with the horizon. A river snakes through the landscape, shimmering like a strand of blue jewels. Fields of wildflowers bloom in profusion, displaying a spectrum of colors that catch the eye and petals that sway gently in the breeze. The sky offers a tapestry of clouds by day, bursting into vivid colors as the sun sets.
