Once upon a time, in a vibrant and cheerful land called Sunlit Valley, there was a king named Oliver. King Oliver was known far and wide for his endless joy and kind heart. His laughter was as contagious as a ticklish breeze and his smile as bright as the morning sun. He wore a crown that glimmered with gold and sapphires, and his royal robe was deeply embroidered with pictures of the animals and plants of his kingdom. His hair was a curly mop of golden-brown locks that bounced merrily as he walked or laughed. His skin was caramel-toned and glowed with the health and happiness that radiated from within him. Every morning, King Oliver would walk through his gardens, marveling at the blooms and creatures that lived there. The garden path was lined with fragrant roses in every shade of color, butterflies flitting from blossom to blossom, and birds singing sweet songs that filled the air.
